1. Updated the variable name `SnakeArr` to `snakeArr` to follow JavaScript naming conventions.

2. Adjusted the `speed` value from `5` to `19` to make the snake move faster.

3. Moved the closing brace `}` of the `gameEngine` function to include the code for moving the snake and displaying the snake and food elements.

4. Adjusted the loop condition in the `gameEngine` function for moving the snake. The condition `i <= 0` has been changed to `i >= 0` to iterate from the end of the `snakeArr` array.

5. Moved the code for updating the score and generating new food inside the `if(snakeArr[0].y === food.y && snakeArr[0].x === food.x)` condition.

6. Corrected the variable name `highscoreval` to `highscoreval` in the code block that updates the high score.

7. Adjusted the variable name `hiscore` to `hiscore` for consistency.

8. Fixed the syntax for assigning classes to the snake and food elements. Changed `snakeElement.classList.add(snake);` to `snakeElement.classList.add('snake');` and `foodElement.classList.add(food);` to `foodElement.classList.add('food');`.

9. Corrected the variable name `hiscoreBox` to `highscoreBox` when updating the high score display.

10. Moved the closing brace `}` of the `main` function to include the code for starting the game and playing move sounds.

Other than these changes, the logic and structure of the code remain the same as in your original code.
